- ClassicalTimeRequest.  Not sure how this should work.  Should it be the
  sum of all time requests that must be made in nights or a multiple of 10 hrs?
  Or should each and every component of a joint be made in nights or a
  multiple of 10?  Seems like the former because you could have a joint with
  one part 5 hours and the other part also 5 hours?  What if one part is 10 hrs
  and the other part is 1 hour, but the 1 hour partner recommends 0?

- RankingCheck, ReferenceCheck, SubmissionPartnerCheck.  Testing the "ignore
 joint proposal" branch is difficult because we need a mock hibernate session.
