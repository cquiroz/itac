EXPORT
========================

Example invocation to export data from a database.
mvn -o -e exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="edu.gemini.tac.persistence.util.ExportData" 

IMPORT
========================

Reset the test database
-----------------------

Select profile initDatabase for itac_test or initJettyDatabase for itac_dev.

mvn exec:exec -PinitDatabase --> reset test database
mvn exec:exec -PinitJettyDatabase --> reset jetty / development database


Load prepared test data into jetty / development database
---------------------------------------------------------
[CURRENTLY ONLY THE DEVELOPMENT DATABASE IS SUPPORTED, LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED TO LOAD DATA INTO THE TEST DATABASE, TOO]

mvn exec:exec -PloadDatabase --> load 2011A proposals into development databse

This takes about 5 to 6 minutes and will leave you with a committee (id=1000) that has all 2011A proposals loaded and
merged according to the current implementation. This will also allow to create database dumps for the qa environment
a bit quicker in the future...

Loading an arbitrary file into the dev database:
------------------------------------------------

By overriding the property "itac.database.loadDataFile" you can load an arbitrary datafile into the development database.
Note: currently it has to be a file (e.g. tar), a directory will not work. Need to adapt the importer if we want this to work.
Note2: command has to be run in the data module directory.

mvn exec:exec -PloadDatabase [-Ditac.database.loadDataFile=<myFile>]

CONTENTS OF EMAIL DESCRIBING ALTERNATIVE TEST STRATEGY
In order to speed up our testing I changed the build a little bit. There
is now a new class FastHibernateFixture that can be used as base class for
tests which is resetting the database by loading a dump (using pg_restore)
  instead of truncating and setting up the database over and over again.

  Advantage:
  ==========
  About twice as fast!

  Disadvantage:
  =============
  *pg_dump and pg_restore are used to do this, both commands have to be in
  the path

  *It is assumed that the database user that can dump/restore a database is
  "postgres" ("software" on the build server)

  *Objects from the HibernateFixture are not stored anymore and can not be
  used in the tests to get Ids and the like, Ids and so on have to be
  retrieved through the database.

  How does it work:
  ==================
  The command

      mvn test-compile -PinitDatabase (or any phase after test-compile)

  will now not only reset the database but also create a database dump
  (using the data created by HibernateFixture) in a configurable directory
  (currently /tmp/itac-dumps). This dump will be used by
  FastHibernateFixture to reset the database at the beginning of each test.
