The Queue Service provides access to the Queue Engine to the ITAC web
application.  It ties together the wep app and the Queue Engine and contains a 

* Persistence conversion to handle conversion from/to persistence model
  for core classes.
* Testing support for code that makes use of the persistence conversion.
* Queue Service API written as a collection of Java interfaces, and a
* Queue Service implementation of those interfaces written in Scala.

The Queue Service API is written in terms of the web app data structures for
representing the program queue and the configuration of the queue generation.
It does not explicitly reference Queue Engine data structures or services.

The implementation translates the web app data structures into versions
palatable by the Queue Engine and generates the queue, returning the result
to the caller.

TODO: how the dependency injection will work.
